    <p>
        I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving problems and creating things that can help people. Technology is constantly evolving, and I am excited by the idea of learning new skills and building innovative solutions. I love the combination of creativity and logic involved in programming, and I am motivated by the opportunity to turn ideas into real, functional applications. Becoming a developer will allow me to grow continuously, work on meaningful projects, and contribute to the digital world.
